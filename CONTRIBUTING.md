## Coding Rules

To keep the code base of commitlint neat and tidy the following rules apply to every change

- `prettier` is king
- `eslint` is awesome
- Favor micro library over swiss army knives (rimraf, ncp vs. fs-extra)
- Be awesome

> use commands `yarn lint` and `yarn format` to be sure your code
> respect coding rules.

> You can also use `npx prettier --write .` to fix prettier errors

## Commit Rules

To help everyone with understanding the commit history of commitlint the following commit rules are enforced.

- [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/)
- present tense
- maximum of 100 characters
- for bugs, includes the github tag of the issue in the description.
- message format of `$type($scope): $message`

These are the authorized types:

- build
- ci
- chore
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test

> Using the right type is really important since it is used to increase the version number automatically.

Also follow the following rules to ensure a good readibility of the commits

- Provide a short title with a maximum of 100 characters
- Provide a more detailed description containing
  _ What you want to achieve
  _ What you changed
  _ What you added
  _ What you removed

## Git Hook

In order to get feedbacks as soon as possible, we suggest to install git hooks to ensure your commits are compliant before writting them.
Under the hood, it will automatically check the style, format, tests, commit messages, etc.
After installing all the dependencies, please run the command below:

```
npx simple-git-hooks
```

> Remember to use this command everytime you change the hooks in the package.json

## Pull Request

The Pull Request title should follow the same template as commit title (see [commit rules](#commit-rules)). Please also follow the templates provided at the PR creation.

## Test

If you add a feature or fix a bug, you need to provide a test verifying your
improvement. You can launch tests using `yarn test`.

## Versioning

We use [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to handle versioning
automatically.

## Styles

### Colors

Few colors are useful in this projects. You shouldn't need these colors because they are configured in tailwind. But you might need these colors for logos, images, etc.

Colors:

- ![#E71E4D](https://placehold.co/15x15/E71E4D/E71E4D.png) `#E71E4D`
